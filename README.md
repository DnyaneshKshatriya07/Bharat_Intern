# Bharat_Intern
I successfully completed a web development internship at Bharat intern. During this 4 weeks internship, I worked on two projects: Portfolio website and Temperature Converter.

1. Portfolio Website:
I created a personal website to show off my skills and projects. It was like designing a digital resume to impress potential employers. I learned how to make it look good and easy to use.

2. Temperature Converter:
I also made a web tool that can convert temperatures between different units, like Celsius to Fahrenheit. It helped me understand how websites can do more than just look pretty â€“ they can solve real problems.

Overall, these projects taught me a lot about building websites, making them user-friendly, and solving practical issues. I'm excited to use these skills in my future.
